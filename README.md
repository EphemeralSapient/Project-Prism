## Usage

You have the option to either create an account with your email address to access all the features of the app as a student or use the app as a guest without logging in. There are three types of accounts available:

-    Admin account: for professors or teachers, who can access all the features of the app and manage attendance and other information for their classes.
-    Student account: for students, who can view their attendance records, timetables, and other information related to their classes.
-    Guest account: for parents or outsiders, who can view basic information such as timetables and class schedules without logging in. Please note that guest data is not saved on the cloud.

This means that you can use the app without having to enter any login data if you choose to use the guest account feature. However, if you want to access more features or use the app as a student or teacher, you will need to create an account using your email address.
